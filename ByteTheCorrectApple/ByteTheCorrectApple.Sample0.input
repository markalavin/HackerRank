Apple already plans to buy back `$100 billion in shares, including $`16 billion worth last quarter. Icahn probably pounded the dinner table he and Cook shared recently for their much-reported bread-breaking at Icahn's New York apartment. Apple's cash stash currently sits at a whopping `$145 billion but only $`43 billion is in the U.S., which is why Icahn wants to float bonds to cover a buy back.
Fortunately, there are “low-chill” apple varieties for temperate climates. (Chilling hours are defined as nonconsecutive hours of winter temperatures below 45 degrees.) As a general guide, if you live on or near the coast, your garden gets only 100 to 200 chilling hours. Inland San Diego gardens get about 400 to 500 chilling hours — still considered “low chill.”
If this seems a bit like déjà vu, you’ll recall that Apple just held an event to unveil two new iPhone models – the 5c and 5s – back on September 10.
